# IPv6-Forum
IPv6 is next generation version of IP protocol to cater growing needs of Internet Connectivity and scarcity of IPv4 Resources. Internet Society (ISOC) is promoting for adoption of IPv6 since 2011 with the launch of IPv6 Day in the same year. In Pakistan, PTCL celebrated the IPv6 day in unison with International Community for assessing IPv6 adoption.
Next steps are creating a Blog site on WP and get recognition from IPv6 Forum International and ISOC globa and ISOC local and regional chapters.
The domain ipv6forum.pk already registered with PKNIC and hosted on OVH Cloud servers owned by Inara. 
There are some issues on this platform like TLS certificate installation issue, WP pipe line of CI/CD and dedicated resources to work on it.
